## Reflection
### Context
This project was built to practice advanced state management techniques in React, focusing on creating a robust shopping cart experience using React Context and useReducer.

### What I Set Out to Build
I aimed to create a comprehensive shopping cart application that demonstrates:
 - **Efficient State Management**: Using React's Context API and useReducer for complex state logic
 - **Component Composition**: Breaking down the application into reusable components
 - **Interactive User Experience**: Allowing users to dynamically manage cart contents
 - **Flexible Cart Interactions**: Implementing add/remove and quantity adjustment functionality

### Challenges
Key challenges included:
 - Implementing a reducer function to handle different cart actions
 - Managing state immutability while updating cart items
 - Creating a seamless user interface for cart interactions
 - Handling edge cases like adding duplicate items and removing items

## Libraries and Frameworks Used
- **React**: Primary framework for building the user interface
- **React Hooks**: Used for state management
- **CSS**: Custom styles for application layout
